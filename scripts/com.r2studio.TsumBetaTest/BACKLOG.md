# Backlog

All potential changes which would improve the TsumBeta script will be documented in this file.

### Bugs
- On some devices, after game play, rubies are spent when "Magic Time" is offered (reported by TAR). Happened on real phones without "Special screen ratio" (with video evidence) and Nox (not recorded, config details currently unknown). 
- Harden auto start. Clicking the daily banners too fast or while loading can make the game stuck.

### Features
- Add "Spam skill" option to check for skill after every finished chain instead of every chain batch.
- Skill: Jedi Luke (13 swipes technique)
- Rewrite of Settings UI (became too large as single-page, not dynamic regarding settings like "skill level" of Cinderella)
